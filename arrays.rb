# Arrays
# list of strings, Integer, arrays, objects....enclosed in square brackets, separated by comma
# index is position of item in arrays
# nums = [1,2,3,5]
# nums[2] returns index position 3
# nums[6] returns nil as that position has nothing in item

# change inside info via index position then redefine

#how to add to array...redefine the position after the last one 
#nums.push(6) ...will input value in () at the end of array
